<br>I am a second-year PhD student in Social Psychology at the University of Michigan, working with Ethan Kross and Shinobu Kitayama.  

I research how we manage our perspective and emotions in our day-to-day lives to thrive.  Particularly, I study how people experience  (and regulate toward) perspective and emotions beyond the "here and now". I seek to integrate perspectives and methods from social psychology, cultural psychology, and natural language in my work. You can read more about my interests in the Research tab or about my past work in the Publications tab.
