<br>I am a PhD candidated in Psychology at the University of Michigan, working with Drs. [Ethan Kross](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/ekross.html) and [Shinobu Kitayama](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/kitayama.html).  


<b>I study how people pursue well-being</b>

The complex and diverse ways that unfolds in daily life, when it works and when it doesn’t, and in context of the systems in which they live. 

I seek to integrate perspectives and methods from social psychology, cultural psychology, complex systems, and computational approaches in my work.
